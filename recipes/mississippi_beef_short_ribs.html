    <h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ pounds boneless beef short ribs </li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
      <li>1 large onion, sliced </li>
      <li>⅓ cup sliced fresh mushrooms </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>For the Seasoning Mix:</em></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>For the Rest:</em></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>⅔ cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>6 whole pepperoncini peppers</li>
      <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Season short ribs with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Heat oil in a pan over high heat. Add short ribs and sear until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer beef to a baking dish.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to medium-high and add onion and mushrooms to the pan. Season with salt. Saute until mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, combine kosher salt, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, dill, rosemary, thyme, and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl. Sprinkle seasoning mixture evenly over the beef.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle flour over the onion and mushrooms. Stir to coat and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir and bring to a boil; remove from heat. Pour mixture over the beef and cover with pepperoncini. Place butter on top. Cover baking dish with foil.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meat is fork-tender and falls apart easily, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
      <li>Spoon sauce from the bottom of the pan onto the beef to serve. Skim off excess fat as desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><em>Chef's Notes:</em></h2>
    <article>
      The pieces of short rib I used, which were really just neatly cut pieces of super-marbled chuck, where nice and thick, which means if yours aren't, you'll have to adjust the cooking time. The original recipe calls for a few whole pepperoncini, which in hindsight, probably would have worked out better. I used 1/3 cup of sliced peppers, and their intense briny taste almost made this seem too salty. So, like I said in the video, if you do use the sliced ones, be careful not to overdo it.
