    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>½ cup pumpkin puree</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons molasses</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, cloves, and ginger together in a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Beat white sugar, butter, and brown sugar together in another bowl using an electric mixer until light and crumbly. Add eggs; beat for 1 minute. Add pumpkin puree, molasses, and vanilla extract; beat until well blended, about 1 minute. Blend in the flour mixture using the mixer or a wooden spoon until dough is sticky and incorporated.</li>
      <li>Cover dough with waxed paper; refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Dip your hands into a small bowl of water. Shape the dough into two loaves that are 1 inch high, 3 to 4 inches wide, and 10 inches long, Place each loaf onto a baking sheet; top with pumpkin seeds.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are dry, 20 to 24 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Transfer loaves to a flat work surface. Cut each into 10 diagonal slices about 1/2 inch thick. Place sliced biscotti back on the baking sheet.</li>
      <li>Continue baking until light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Continue baking until dry, about 20 minutes more. Transfer to wire racks to cool.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><em>Chef's Notes:</em></h2>
    <article>
      For crisp biscotti, lower the oven temp to 170 degrees F (75 degrees C) and allow biscotti to remain in oven for another 40 minutes. At that time, turn off the oven and let cool inside oven for 1 hour.
